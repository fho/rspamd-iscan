# rspamd-iscan

rspamd-iscan is a daemon that monitors IMAP mailboxes and sends new mails to
[rspamd](https://rspamd.com) for spam analysis and training.
It decouples spam filtering from mail delivery - allowing the MDA,
rspamd and rspamd-iscan to run on totally different hosts.
For example, you can filter mails on the IMAP server of your third-party
provider with your self-hosted rspamd instance.
It is similar to [isbg](https://gitlab.com/isbg/isbg) but uses rspamd instead of
Spamassassin.

rspamd-iscan continuously monitors the IMAP `ScanMailbox` for new mails with
_IMAP IDLE_. \
When a new mail arrives, it is sent to rspamd's HTTP interface for
scanning. The scan result is added as headers to the e-mail and the modified
mail is uploaded to either the `SpamMailbox` or the `InboxMailbox`, depending on
its classification. \
The unmodified original mail is moved from the `ScanMailbox` to the
`BackupMailbox`.

Mails in the `HamMailbox` and `UndetectedMailbox` are periodically processed and
submitted to rspamd to be learned as ham or spam. Mails learned as ham are
moved to `InboxMailbox`, learned Spam mails are moved to `SpamMailbox`.

## Installation

### From Binaries

Download and extract the binary from a [Release](https://github.com/fho/rspamd-iscan/releases).

### From Source

`go install github.com/fho/rspamd-iscan@latest`

## Configuration

### Rspamd

A rspamd instance must have been set up and it's controller HTTP interface must
be reachable.

### IMAP Server

It is recommended to use your `INBOX` mailbox to store scanned HAM mails and
reconfigure your mail-server to store new incoming mails in another mailbox,
e.g. named `Unprocessed`. This does not require changing your mail-clients'
configuration .
If that is not possible, rspamd-iscan can monitor `INBOX` instead and move
filtered Ham mails to another mailbox (e.g. named `Scanned`).
Your mail-clients would then be configured to use `HAM` as inbox.

- Ensure that you have the following mailboxes created on your IMAP server:
  - One to store mails classified as Spam (`SpamMailbox`),
  - One to store mails classified as Spam that was not detected
    (`UndetectedMailbox`),
  - One to store mails that have been wrongly classified as Spam (`HamMailbox`),
  - One to store unprocessed new mails (`ScanMailbox`),
  - One to store scanned mails classified as HAM (`InboxMailbox`)

### rspamd-iscan

rspamd-iscan is configured via a TOML configuration file.
By default it is read from `/etc/rspamd-iscan/config.toml`, another location
can be specified by the `--cfg-file` command line parameter.

Create a new configuration file with the following content and adapt it to your
setup:

```toml
RspamdURL           = "http://192.168.178.2:11334"
RspamdPassword      = "iwonttellyou"
ImapAddr            = "my-imap-server:993"
ImapUser            = "rickdeckard"
ImapPassword        = "zhora"
InboxMailbox        = "INBOX"
SpamMailbox         = "Spam"
HamMailbox          = "Ham"
UndetectedMailbox   = "Undetected"
BackupMailbox       = "Backup"
# TempDir stores downloaded mails and their modified variants with added spam
# headers
TempDir             = "/tmp"
# Set KeepTempFiles to false to delete temporary files after use immediately
KeepTempFiles       = true
ScanMailbox         = "Unscanned"
# Mails with a higher or equal rspamd score than SpamThreshold are moved to
# SpamMailbox, others to HamMailbox
SpamThreshold       = 10.0
```

## Running

```bash
rspamd-iscan --cfg-file /etc/rspamd-iscan/config.toml 
```

better run it via systemd though :-)

## Project Status

The application is work-in-progress, the documented functionality works and is
in use, tests are missing.
